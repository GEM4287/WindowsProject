                <p class= "mytexttype">HTML is not a programming language. It is a markup language that tells browser how to structure web pages.<br>
                • It Consists of series of elements which we use to enclose, wrap or markup different parts of the contents to make it appear or act in certain way.<br>
                • HTML 5 is the latest evolution of the standard that defines HTML.<br>
                • HTML 5 define two different concepts:<br>
                a. It is a new version of the language with new elements and attributes.<br>
                b. A larger set of technologies that allows building more diverse and powerful website and  application.<br>

                <h1 class = "myheadertype">Introduction to CSS.</h1>
                <p class= "mytexttype">CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
                    CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
                    CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
                    External stylesheets are stored in CSS files<br>
                    <h2 style="padding-left: 50px; font-weight: bold;">Why use CSS?</h2>
                </p>
                <p class= "mytexttype">
                    CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.<br>
                    HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!. HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:<br>
                    <h1 style="padding-left: 40px;">< h1>This is a heading< /h1></h1>
                    <p class= "mytexttype"> < p> This is a paragraph.< /p></p>
                </p>
                <p class= "mytexttype">
                    When tags like font, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process. To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS. CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!<br><br>

                <h1 class = "myheadertype">Introduction to JAVASCRIPT.</h1>
                <p class= "mytexttype">A lightweight scripting language, created in 1995 by Brendan Eich , originally called LiveScript.<br>
                    It is an Interpreted language.<br>
                    Most modern JS interpreter uses technique called Just In-Time(JIT) compiling to improve performance. JS source code gets compiled into a faster binary format while the script is being used, so that it can run as quickly as possible. Since compilation happens in runtime rather ahead of time, JS is considered as interpreted language.<br>
                    Client Side and Server side code:
                    <ul class = "mytexttype" style="padding-left: 100px;">
                        <li>Client side code runs on the user’s computer, code is downloaded and run by the browser.</li>
                        <li>Server side code runs on the server, then its results are downloaded and displayed in the browser.</li>
